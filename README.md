# Project Name
Weekend Jquery Salary Calculator

## Description
_Duration: Weekend Homework Assignment (Thurs-Fri)_

I created an application that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_ and tracks a monthly salary budget based on annual salary for all employees.

Once user input is submitted using a submit button, it collects the information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs and displays that information to the DOM. It calculates monthly costs and displays to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000 a red color warning will apply to the total monthly cost to alert the user.

Employees can be deleted from the DOM using a delete button.

**remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.
